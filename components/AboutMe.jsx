                      I found a passion for web development in recent years and have been working on a career change. 
                      Through self study and attending College of San Mateo, Ive been able to apply my knowledge to assist local businesses in the Bay Area. 
                      My portfolio displays websites Ive created for those businesses. 
                      I specialize in frontend development though I have backend experience aswell. 
                       I continue to be an eager programmer that is always ready to rise up to the next innovative challenge.
